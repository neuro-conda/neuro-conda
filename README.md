# neuro-conda
A Python distribution for Neuroscience based on [conda](https://www.anaconda.com)

Although creating a virtual environment for each project is considered best practice, it can be a major obstacle for early-career neuroscientists that are just starting to learn programming. neuro-conda aims to simplify learning and using Python in Neuroscience by bundling commonly used packages in Neuroscience into tested and versioned conda environments. 

It is inspired by similar projects at the [Ernst Str√ºngmann Institute for Neuroscience](https://github.com/esi-neuroscience/esi-conda) and [University of Cambridge](https://github.com/jooh/neuroconda) providing read-made environments at their computing clusters.
