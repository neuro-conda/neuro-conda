# neuro-conda
A Python distribution based on conda for Neuroscience

Although creating a virtual environment for each project is considered best practice, it can be a major obstacle for early-career neuroscientists that are just starting to learn programming. neuro-conda aims to simplify learning and using Python in Neuroscience by bundling commonly used packages in Neuroscience into tested and versioned conda environments.
